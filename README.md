# Introduction

Midso is a decentralized e-commerce based 100% on Midnight, which protects the privacy of the buyer and seller. Products can be bought and sold using Midnight and Cardano native assets.

Midso solves a key challenge in decentralized e-commerce by protecting users' private data using Midnight smart contracts. Offering a solution to the problem of mass adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.

On Midso, products can be purchased using a Cardano or Midnight wallet. The trading process between the seller and the buyer is handled by Plutus V3 contracts.
Using a Cardano smart-contract allows to use **_ADA_**, **_stablecoin_** and **_native asset_** as a form of payment for the products.
In addition, the implementation of other innovative and deterministic trading logics. It is also compatible with the **_midnight network._**

Midso also leverages the collective intelligence of its DAO members to conduct market and product research that benefits the Cardano community.
These features empower any community member to become a seller and launch their own store.
